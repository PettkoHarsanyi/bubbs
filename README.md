# bubbs
Bubbs is a very simple half-done JavaScript game. The game is about reaching the green zone before time runs out, something like the popular Battle Royale games nowadays. It is half-done, because the backend the leaderboard and the how-to pages are missing. Kind of the whole point. XD But still you can try out the game.
